### Definition for autonomous 
- We may take a look at it by understanding what autonomous car (self-driving car) is: a vehicle that is capable of sensing its environment and moving safely with little or no human input.(from https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Self-driving_car)

- Why is virtual autonomous system platform so important nowadays?
  * Autonomy means that machines or devices can make decisions independently without any assistance from people. The machine used in factory can be regards as a basic aspect of      autonomy. But what autonomy really wants to achieve in the last is that the autonomous devices can make the best choice based on the situatioins and the factors or information    they collected.
  * However, it is not very easy to get a physical autonomous device. In this way, the virtual platform can help us a lot. Virtual autonomous platform is trying to emulate a real   environment where autonomous devices can work as we expected. Then, it will probably work just fine if we move to the real world. In this way, it can save the beginner or         developer a lot of time to do trials and make testing or learning faster. 
  
  -Aim of this repository
   * This repository is to discover as many as virtual autonomous platform for developers or beginners so that they can save time in doing that and just make the best use of what has been discovered for their studying and development. 
   * The platforms do not just include the platforms for drones, but it also has multiple virtual platforms of other devices like robots to help to better understand what autonomy is and factors that should be taken into consideration when solving the physical problems of a autonomous devices.
