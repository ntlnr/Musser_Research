### Definition for autonomous 
- We may take a look at it by understanding what autonomous car (self-driving car) is: a vehicle that is capable of sensing its environment and moving safely with little or no human input.(from https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Self-driving_car)

- Why is virtual autonomous system platform so important nowadays?
  Autonomy means that machines or devices can make decisions independently without any assistance from people. The machine used in factory can be regards as a basic aspect of      autonomy. But what autonomy really wants to achieve in the last is that the autonomous devices can make the best choice based on the situatioins and the factors or information they collected.
  However, it is not very easy to get a physical autonomous device. In this way, the virtual platform can help us a lot. Virtual autonomous platform is trying to emulate a real environment where autonomous devices can work as we expected. Then, it will probably work just fine if we move to the real world. In this way, it can save the beginner or developer a lot of time to do trials and make testing or learning faster.
